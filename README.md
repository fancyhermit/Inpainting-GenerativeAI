# Video Segmentation and Object Inpainting using SAM2 and Stable Diffusion

## Overview
This project explores **video segmentation** using **Segment Anything Model (SAM2)** and **generative AI-based inpainting** using **Stable Diffusion**. The goal is to perform object removal or replacement in video sequences, where **inpainting** is applied to generate new objects or restore backgrounds seamlessly.

## Key Features
- **Video Segmentation**: Leverages **SAM2** to precisely segment objects from video frames, identifying areas to be manipulated (removed or replaced).
- **Generative Inpainting**: Implements **Stable Diffusion** to inpaint the segmented areas, generating realistic content to either replace removed objects or restore missing parts of the video.
- **Object Removal and Replacement**: Attempts both object removal and replacement in video frames by generating context-aware content for smooth visual transitions.
- **Generative Object Creation**: Uses **Stable Diffusion** to create new objects in the video frames, providing an innovative approach to video editing.

## Project Objectives
1. **Experiment with Video Segmentation**: Practice using SAM2 for object segmentation in a variety of video scenes.
2. **Apply Generative Inpainting**: Use Stable Diffusion's inpainting capabilities to replace or remove objects seamlessly.
3. **Enhance Video Editing Techniques**: Explore how machine learning models can push the boundaries of traditional video editing, focusing on object manipulation.
